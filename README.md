Title:
Movie Rec

Description:
The objective is to create a website where many people at home quarantined can look for a show or movie to watch. There are many people at home that just finished binge-watching their favorite show, and then what? The next best thing is to look for another show to watch, and we built this website to help them find other movies and shows recommended for them based on their search categories. In a whole world full of options, this site will save them time from researching and investigating and allowing them to use that saved time to watch more TV.

The way the site works is that it will initially show the top TV shows and movies. The user can then filter by year, actor, and length, and below will show a list of movie posters with the title under it. When the user clicks on the title, an overview of the movie or show will appear in addition to the average score.

The motivation for the site is that we wanted to make it humorous, relevant to the present and the pandemic, and all of us like to watch movies and tv shows. When you combine all of that, we came up with our site. There is a truth in the fact that more people are watching television more than ever, and we want to help entertain people while they are at home and as unproductive as watching TV maybe, the hope is that their minds will not focus on the pandemic and all the negative it has made on this world and instead entertain and make them happy. 


Conflicts:

Some of the conflicts we encountered were learning each other's skills, working as a team, learning when to push, and merging our coding. Also, coming up with the initial game plan was a little more complicated than needed because we all had our ideas, and it was hard to see the other team mates' vision. Once we understood the communication and understanding of the push and pull process, we began to see a lot more progress. 

Another issue was figuring out what API to use and how specific we want our site to be. Initially, we had a vision of grandeur, and when we kept thinking MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we pulled back on aiming for perfection and moved forward faster with baby steps. Also, figuring out what API worked and what didn't work causes many issues. Dan and Nikki helped a lot with that. 

Learning Lessons:

Working with a team and the different personalities that come with those teams were a big learning lesson. The thought is that being a programmer is a solo job and knowing how much teamwork it involves was interesting. Also, the MVP concept was a big learning lesson because, as coders, you want to put out the perfect page fast, but it doesn't always work like that; you need MVP first and build from there.
